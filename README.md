# Image-to-Sound
This project involves creating a Python program that converts images into sound by interpreting the image data as audio signals. This can be an interesting way to explore the relationship between visual and auditory information and to learn about digital signal processing.
# Image to Sound Converter

This project, "Image to Sound Converter," is a fascinating exploration of the intersection between visual and auditory data. The Python script takes an image as input and converts it into a unique sequence of sounds by mapping the brightness of each pixel to a specific frequency.

## Features

- Converts the brightness values of an image's pixels into sound frequencies.
- Generates a sequence of tones that represent the visual information.
- Provides an experimental way to 'hear' images.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, you will need:

- Python 3.10
- Pillow (PIL Fork) for image processing
- simpleaudio for sound playback

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install Pillow simpleaudio
